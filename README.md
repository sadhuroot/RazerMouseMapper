## üõ°Ô∏è Permissions Explained

This app requires **Input Monitoring** permission to:
- Detect mouse button presses
- Intercept and remap button actions
- Provide system-wide functionality

Your privacy is important. The app:
- ‚úÖ Only monitors mouse events
- ‚úÖ Doesn't collect or transmit any data
- ‚úÖ Runs entirely locally on your Mac
- ‚úÖ Is open source for transparency


## üîß Troubleshooting

### App doesn't detect mouse clicks
1. Ensure Input Monitoring permission is granted
2. Restart the application
3. Try toggling the permission off and on in System Preferences

### Custom shortcuts not working
1. Verify the shortcut isn't already used by macOS or another app
2. Use the debug mode to confirm button presses are detected
3. Check that the shortcut syntax is correct (e.g., `cmd+shift+a`)

### Mouse not detected
- The app works with most mice, not just Razer
- Try unplugging and reconnecting your mouse
- Check if your mouse appears in System Information ‚Üí USB
